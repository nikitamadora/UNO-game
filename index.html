          <h2>welcome to stubborn kittens!</h2>
          <!-- <h2>also temporarily known as foster frenzy!</h2> -->
          <!-- <p>Congratulations! You've been approved as a foster home for all of the local cats you could want! You have grand dreams of being a crazy cat person, but you are also afraid of commitment. This seems like a reasonable middle ground tbh.</p>
          <p></p> -->
          <p>In this delightfully silly game, your goal is to clear the bottom row (your house) of all the kittens who keep stubbornly coming in. There is a box put out by the *amazing* local shelter. They have a list of *hundreds* of pre-approved hopefuls who are waiting to take all these cats, so fill up the box and empty your house! But be careful.. if the neighbor empties their house of cats before you do, they'll take the box in, and you'll be stuck with the cats forever! Tragic?</p>
