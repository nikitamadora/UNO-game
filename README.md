##WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?


WHY DID I MAKE IT?


USER STORIES


     i.        The user clicks "START" button to start the game

     ii.       The game deals seven cards to the player, which are visible at the bottom of the screen, and flips a card from the draw pile into the center of the screen. This is the discard pile. The user compares their cards against the discarded card, looking for a color (Red, Yellow, Blue, or Green), or a number match (Numbers 0 - 9).

     iii.      When the user clicks an invalid card, an alert tells them they must choose a card that matches either the color or the number on the face of the discard pile, or must be a wild card.

     iv.       When the user clicks a matching card, it is sent to the top of the discard pile, and their turn ends.

     v.        If there is no valid card in their hand, the user draws a single card from the draw pile. If this is a valid card, they may play it immediately. If it is not, their turn ends.

     vi.       After the computer takes a turn, the user and computer trade turns.

     vii.      When the user plays a "DRAW 2" card, the computer is dealt two new cards from the top of the draw pile, and vice versa.

     viii.     When the user plays a "WILD" card, a small selection area displays showing the four color options. The user chooses a color, and the wild card changes into a card of the chosen color as it's added to the discard pile.

     ix.       When the user has to play against a wild card, they must play a card of the matching color, or choose a wild card.

     x.        When the user is down to their last card, a message reads "Uno!" in a speech bubble "from" the bottom of the screen. The reverse is true for the computer.

     xi.       As the user clicks their final card into the discard pile, the game screen fades and brightens, and a boxed message pops up that reads "You Did It!" A button fades in that reads "Wanna win again?"

     xii.      When the user loses to the computer, the game screen fades and darkens, and a boxed message pops up that reads "Womp Womp, Beat By A Dumb AI". A button fades in that reads "Retry?"
